##.emacs.d
This is my personal .emacs.d directory.  I typically use emacs under Windows.

##Installation Steps For a New System
1. Download emacs for Windows from [gnu.org](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/)
2. Clone this directory into C:\Users\\[user]\AppData\Roaming
3. Download Aspell for Windows from [here](http://aspell.net/win32/)
4. Open init-local.el_template and save as init-local.el
5. Change init-local.el variables to current computer settings.
6. Launch emacs and let it install all the packages from init-packages.
